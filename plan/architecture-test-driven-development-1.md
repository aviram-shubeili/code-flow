# Introduction

This implementation plan establishes a comprehensive test-driven development (TDD) architecture for the CodeFlow project. The current project lacks proper testing infrastructure, with only basic database connection scripts. This plan will implement a robust testing framework suitable for AI agent delegation, ensuring code quality, reliability, and maintainability across all development phases.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-001**: Implement comprehensive test coverage for all application layers (unit, integration, e2e)
- **REQ-002**: Establish TDD workflow where tests are written before implementation
- **REQ-003**: Create agent-friendly test specifications that can be executed autonomously
- **REQ-004**: Support Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Auth.js testing requirements
- **REQ-005**: Integrate with existing Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL database setup
- **REQ-006**: Maintain compatibility with current Docker development environment
- **REQ-007**: Enable CI/CD pipeline integration for automated testing

- **SEC-001**: Test environment must be isolated from production data
- **SEC-002**: Authentication tests must not expose real credentials
- **SEC-003**: Database tests must use dedicated test databases

- **PER-001**: Tests must execute quickly to support rapid development cycles
- **PER-002**: Parallel test execution must be supported for CI/CD efficiency

- **CON-001**: Must work within existing Next.js and TypeScript architecture
- **CON-002**: Cannot break existing development workflow or Docker setup
- **CON-003**: Must support both local development and CI/CD environments

- **GUD-001**: Follow AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) testing pattern
- **GUD-002**: Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested
- **GUD-003**: Maintain test independence and isolation
- **GUD-004**: Implement test data factories for consistent setup

- **PAT-001**: Use Vitest as primary testing framework for modern TypeScript support
- **PAT-002**: Implement MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
- **PAT-003**: Use Testing Library for React component testing
- **PAT-004**: Establish clear test organization and naming conventions
