# CodeFlow - Progress Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-27

## Current Development Phase: Foundation & Testing Infrastructure Setup

### Overall Project Status: ðŸ”„ In Active Development
**Completion Estimate:** ~30% of MVP foundation complete (including testing architecture)

## What's Working âœ…

### Development Environment
- **Docker Setup:** PostgreSQL and pgAdmin containers configured and running
- **Environment Management:** Comprehensive npm scripts for all development tasks
- **Database Tools:** Drizzle Studio, health checks, and migration scripts working
- **Code Quality:** ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript strict mode configured

### Project Structure
- **Next.js App Router:** Modern routing structure established
- **TypeScript Configuration:** Strict mode with proper path mapping
- **Component Architecture:** Clear separation between auth, UI, and business components
- **Database Schema:** Auth.js compatible schema with Drizzle ORM

### Authentication Foundation
- **Auth.js Integration:** Basic configuration with GitHub provider
- **Session Management:** Database session storage configured
- **Route Protection:** Middleware and page-level authentication guards
- **OAuth Flow:** GitHub OAuth application connection established

### Database Layer
- **PostgreSQL:** Running in Docker with persistent volumes
- **Drizzle ORM:** Schema definition and migration system
- **Connection Management:** Health checks and connection testing
- **Auth Integration:** Drizzle adapter for Auth.js working

### Testing Architecture Foundation
- **Framework Research:** Validated Vitest + React Testing Library approach through analysis of Next.js, T3 stack, Playwright, and Vitest repositories
- **Database Testing Strategy:** Docker container isolation pattern defined (test db on port 5433)
- **Professional Patterns:** Documented real-world testing approaches from production repositories
- **Implementation Plan:** Complete TDD architecture plan with feature-based test organization

## What's Left to Build ðŸš§

### Phase 1: Testing Infrastructure Implementation (In Progress)
- **Vitest Setup:** Install and configure Vitest with TypeScript support and React Testing Library
- **Test Environment:** Docker test database container (port 5433) and environment configuration
- **Test Utilities:** Database cleanup helpers and test data seeding capabilities
- **Basic Test Coverage:** Unit tests for auth utilities and component tests for basic UI elements

### Phase 2: Core Features (Next Major Phase)
- **GitHub API Integration:** GraphQL client setup and PR data fetching
- **PR Categorization Logic:** Business rules for four dashboard sections:
  1. Needs Your Review (with first review vs. re-review differentiation)
  2. Returned to You (changes requested)
  3. My PRs - Awaiting Review
  4. Reviewed - Awaiting Author (conditional based on API capabilities)
- **Dashboard Layout:** Main UI structure with section organization
- **PR Card Components:** Reusable components with all required data fields

### Phase 3: API Development & Integration Testing
- **Backend API Routes:** Four specific PR data endpoints following REST patterns
- **GitHub GraphQL Queries:** Efficient queries for PR data with proper filtering
- **Data Transformation:** Convert GitHub API responses to standardized PR objects
- **Caching Strategy:** Backend caching for GitHub API responses (memory/PostgreSQL)
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

### UI Components
- **Status Badge System:** Color-coded badges (Amber, Pink, Red, Blue/Grey)
- **PR Card Layout:** Avatar, ID, title, author, badge, comments, timestamp, changes
- **Interactive Elements:** Clickable cards opening GitHub PRs in new tabs
- **Responsive Design:** Desktop/laptop optimization with basic mobile support
- **Loading States:** Progressive loading and skeleton screens
- **Empty States:** Informative messages for empty sections

### Data Integration
- **GitHub GraphQL Queries:** Efficient queries for PR data
- **Rate Limiting:** Respect GitHub API limits
- **Real-time Updates:** Manual refresh functionality
- **Data Normalization:** Consistent data structure across components

## Current Status by Feature Area

### ðŸŸ¢ Completed (Ready for Production)
- Project setup and configuration
- Development environment (Docker, scripts, tooling)
- Database schema and connection management
- Basic authentication infrastructure
- Code quality tooling and standards

### ðŸŸ¡ In Progress (Active Development)
- **Authentication Flow Testing:** Verifying end-to-end OAuth integration
- **Component Architecture:** Establishing patterns for dashboard components
- **API Route Structure:** Designing backend endpoints for PR data

### ðŸ”´ Not Started (Planned)
- GitHub API client implementation
- PR data fetching and categorization
- Dashboard UI implementation
- Status badge system
- Responsive design implementation

### âšª Future Scope (Post-MVP)
- Multi-repository support
- Advanced filtering options
- Team-level features
- Performance analytics
- Notification preferences

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Current Technical Debt
- **Auth.js Beta Version:** Using beta version may require updates
- **Error Handling:** Need consistent error handling patterns
- **Type Coverage:** Some areas need better TypeScript coverage
- **Testing:** No test suite established yet

### Performance Considerations
- **Bundle Size:** Need to monitor and optimize bundle size
- **Database Queries:** Optimize query performance as data grows
- **API Rate Limits:** Implement efficient caching strategy
- **Loading Performance:** Optimize initial page load times

### Security Audits Needed
- **Environment Variables:** Verify all secrets properly protected
- **OAuth Configuration:** Review OAuth security settings
- **Database Security:** Ensure proper access controls
- **API Security:** Implement proper validation and sanitization

## Dependencies & Blockers

### External Dependencies
- **GitHub OAuth App:** Requires proper configuration and secrets
- **Database Connection:** PostgreSQL must be accessible and properly configured
- **GitHub API Access:** Need valid API tokens and proper scopes

### Internal Blockers
- **Schema Stability:** Database schema must be finalized before building data layer
- **Authentication Completion:** Full auth flow must work before building protected features
- **API Design:** Backend API structure affects all frontend development
