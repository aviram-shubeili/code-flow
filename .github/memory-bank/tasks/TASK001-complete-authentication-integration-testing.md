# [TASK001] - Complete Authentication Integration Testing

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** 2025-07-23  
**Updated:** 2025-07-23

## Original Request
Based on the current project state, we need to thoroughly test and validate the GitHub OAuth authentication flow to ensure it's working properly before building the core dashboard features.

## Thought Process
The authentication system is the foundation of the entire application. Without a fully working auth flow, we can't proceed with building the protected dashboard features. The current setup includes:

1. Auth.js (NextAuth) v5.0.0-beta configuration
2. GitHub OAuth provider setup
3. Database session storage with Drizzle adapter
4. Basic route protection middleware

We need to verify each part of this flow works correctly:
- OAuth authorization with GitHub
- Token exchange and session creation
- Session persistence in PostgreSQL
- Protected route access
- Sign out functionality

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Verify GitHub OAuth application configuration
- [ ] Test complete OAuth authorization flow
- [ ] Validate session creation and storage in database
- [ ] Test protected route access and middleware
- [ ] Verify session persistence across browser sessions
- [ ] Test sign-out functionality
- [ ] Document any issues or configuration requirements

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 10%
