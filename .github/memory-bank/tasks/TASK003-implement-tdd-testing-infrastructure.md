# [TASK003] - Implement TDD Testing Infrastructure

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** 2025-07-27  
**Updated:** 2025-07-27

## Original Request
Execute Phase 1 of the test-driven development architecture plan to establish comprehensive testing infrastructure following professional best practices from real-world repositories.

## Thought Process
After reviewing the complexity of enterprise-level TDD approaches, we simplified the plan to focus on essential testing infrastructure suitable for a personal project while maintaining professional standards. Research of major repositories (Next.js, T3 stack, Playwright, Vitest) validated our approach and provided concrete implementation patterns.

**Key Research Findings:**
- **Next.js repository**: Uses Vitest with React Testing Library, feature-based test organization
- **T3 stack**: Docker container pattern for test database isolation on separate port (5433)
- **Playwright repository**: Comprehensive environment configuration patterns
- **Vitest repository**: TypeScript native support with excellent performance

**Decision Rationale:**
- Vitest chosen over Jest for TypeScript native support and speed
- Docker containers for test database isolation following T3 pattern
- Feature-based test organization for maintainability
- Professional cleanup utilities pattern from production repos

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1.1: Core Framework Setup
- Install Vitest ^2.0.0 and React Testing Library dependencies
- Configure vitest.config.ts with TypeScript and React support
- Set up test script in package.json
- Create basic test file structure and naming conventions

### Phase 1.2: Test Environment Configuration
- Create test environment configuration (.env.test)
- Set up separate test database configuration
- Configure path aliases for testing (matching main project)
- Add test globals and setup files

### Phase 1.3: Database Test Infrastructure
- Configure Docker test database container (PostgreSQL on port 5433)
- Create database test utilities and cleanup helpers
- Implement test data seeding capabilities
- Set up database schema for testing

### Phase 1.4: Basic Test Implementation
- Write unit tests for authentication utilities
- Create component tests for basic UI elements (SignIn, UserInfo)
- Test database connection and health check functions
- Validate test isolation and cleanup

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
