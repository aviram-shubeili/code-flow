# [TASK002] - Implement GitHub API Client Setup

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** 2025-07-23  
**Updated:** 2025-07-23

## Original Request
Set up GraphQL client for GitHub API integration to fetch PR data for the four dashboard sections according to MVP specifications.

## Thought Process
Based on the comprehensive analysis of the specification documents, the GitHub API integration is critical for the core functionality. The MVP requires:

1. Four distinct PR data endpoints for different dashboard sections
2. Complex business logic for PR categorization based on user relationship
3. Efficient GraphQL queries to minimize API calls and respect rate limits
4. Data transformation from GitHub's schema to our standardized format

The GitHub GraphQL API v4 provides the necessary data, but requires careful query design to:
- Filter PRs by user review assignments
- Identify first review vs. re-review scenarios  
- Determine PR status relative to the logged-in user
- Fetch all required PR metadata efficiently

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Research GitHub GraphQL schema for PR and review data
- [ ] Set up GraphQL client (Apollo Client or similar)
- [ ] Design queries for the four dashboard sections
- [ ] Create data transformation layer
- [ ] Implement rate limiting awareness
- [ ] Set up error handling for API failures
- [ ] Create mock data for development/testing
