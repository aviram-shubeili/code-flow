# CodeFlow - Active Context

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-27  
**Current Branch:** main

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Objective
Implementing comprehensive test-driven development (TDD) architecture for CodeFlow based on real-world best practices. Moving from foundational setup to professional testing infrastructure to ensure code quality and stability for portfolio demonstration.

### Recent Context
- Completed research of production testing patterns from major repositories (Next.js, T3 stack, Playwright, Vitest)
- Updated implementation plan with professional database testing strategies
- Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation of testing framework
- Foundation authentication and database integration completed

### Active Decisions & Considerations

#### Testing Framework Strategy
- **Decision:** Vitest as primary testing framework for TypeScript native support
- **Integration:** React Testing Library for component testing
- **Database Testing:** Docker containers for isolated test databases (following T3 pattern)
- **Organization:** Feature-based test structure for maintainability
- **Current State:** Planning complete, ready for implementation

#### Database Testing Architecture (Research-Based)
- **Pattern:** Separate PostgreSQL test container on port 5433
- **Isolation:** Complete separation between dev (5432) and test (5433) databases  
- **Cleanup:** Automated database cleanup between test runs
- **Speed:** In-memory tmpfs for faster test execution
- **Current State:** Architecture defined, ready to implement

#### Development Workflow
- **Approach:** Start simple with unit tests, gradually add integration tests
- **Priority:** Critical paths first (auth, database, API routes)
- **Coverage Goal:** 80% for overall completion milestone
- **Current State:** Phase 1 tasks defined and ready to execute

## Next Immediate Steps

### Short-term Priorities (Current Sprint)
1. **Phase 1: Core Testing Infrastructure**
   - Install and configure Vitest with TypeScript support
   - Set up React Testing Library integration
   - Create test environment configuration
   - Establish basic test file structure

2. **Database Test Setup**
   - Implement Docker test database container
   - Create test environment variables (.env.test)
   - Build database test utilities and cleanup helpers
   - Validate test database isolation

3. **Begin Dashboard Foundation**
   - Create dashboard layout with four defined sections
   - Implement authentication guards and protected routing
   - Set up manual refresh functionality

### Medium-term Goals (Next 2-3 weeks)
1. **Core PR Data Pipeline**
   - Build four specific API routes for PR categorization
   - Implement business logic for section filtering:
     - Needs Your Review (with first review vs. re-review logic)
     - Returned to You (changes requested status)
     - My PRs - Awaiting Review
     - Reviewed - Awaiting Author (conditional)
   - Create backend caching strategy for GitHub data

2. **UI Component Development**
   - Build PR card components with all required fields:
     - Author avatar, PR ID/number, title, username
     - Status badges (Amber, Pink, Red, Blue/Grey)
     - Comment count, timestamp, code changes (+/-)
   - Implement responsive dashboard layout
   - Create loading, empty, and error state components

3. **MVP Feature Completion**
   - Clickable PR cards opening GitHub in new tabs
   - Manual refresh with loading indicators
   - Error handling with retry mechanisms

## Current Challenges & Blockers

### Technical Challenges
- **Auth.js Beta:** Working with beta version requires careful documentation review
- **GitHub GraphQL Complexity:** Need to design efficient queries for four distinct PR categories
- **Status Logic:** Implementing complex business rules for PR categorization (first review vs. re-review)
- **Type Safety:** Ensuring end-to-end TypeScript coverage across all layers
- **Rate Limiting:** Managing GitHub API limits with effective caching strategy

### Learning Curve Items
- **GitHub GraphQL Schema:** Understanding PR review states and filtering capabilities
- **Drizzle ORM:** New ORM syntax and migration patterns
- **App Router:** Next.js 13+ App Router patterns and Server Components
- **Auth.js v5:** Updated authentication patterns from v4
- **Caching Strategies:** Backend caching for API responses

### Dependencies & Prerequisites
- **GitHub OAuth App:** Need properly configured OAuth application
- **Database Schema:** Must be stable before building data layer
- **API Design:** Backend API structure affects frontend component design

## Key Architecture Decisions Made

### Technology Choices Confirmed
‚úÖ **Next.js App Router** - Modern React development  
‚úÖ **TypeScript Strict Mode** - Full type safety  
‚úÖ **Drizzle ORM** - Type-safe database operations  
‚úÖ **Auth.js with GitHub** - Secure authentication  
‚úÖ **Tailwind + Shadcn** - Modern UI development  
‚úÖ **Docker Compose** - Consistent development environment

### Patterns Established
‚úÖ **API Route Architecture** - Next.js API routes as backend facade  
‚úÖ **Component Structure** - Clear separation of concerns  
‚úÖ **Database Migrations** - Version-controlled schema evolution  
‚úÖ **Environment Management** - Secure secrets handling

## Project Health Indicators
