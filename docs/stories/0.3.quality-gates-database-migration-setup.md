# Story 0.3: Quality Gates & Database Migration Setup

Status: drafted

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** quality gates and database migration automation established so that code quality is enforced and database changes are safely deployed while Vercel handles deployment automatically,
**so that** I can ensure reliable deployments and maintain code quality standards.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. GitHub Actions workflow for quality gates (test, lint, build validation)
2. Database migration automation for production deployments
3. Branch protection rules that work with Vercel's automatic deployment
4. Build quality gates that prevent bad code from reaching Vercel deployment
5. Database migration status reporting and rollback procedures
6. Integration with Vercel's Git-based deployment workflow

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From story 0.2, we have a comprehensive testing framework with Vitest, React Testing Library, and proper mock configurations. All tests are passing with coverage reporting configured at 80% thresholds. The testing infrastructure provides a solid foundation for quality gates.

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Required CI/CD Technologies:**
- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions (native GitHub integration, Vercel deployment via GitHub)
- **Build Tool**: Next.js + Turbopack 15.0+ (monorepo build system, optimized for Vercel deployment)
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest 1.6+ + Testing Library 14+ (already configured in 0.2)
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright 1.40+ (cross-browser reliability, excellent CI/CD integration)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (automatic deployment via GitHub integration)

### Deployment Strategy Integration
[Source: architecture/deployment-strategy.md]

**Vercel Deployment Pipeline:**
- **Git-based Deployment**: Vercel automatically deploys on successful push to main
- **Environment Management**: Main branch → Production, PR branches → Preview deployments
- **Quality Gates Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow must pass before merge to main
- **Database Migration Strategy**: Run migrations in GitHub Actions before/after Vercel deployment

**Required GitHub Actions Configuration:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/quality-gates.yml structure
name: Quality Gates for Vercel Deployment
on:
  push: [main]
  pull_request: [main]
env:
  NODE_VERSION: 22
jobs:
  quality-gates:
    # Type checking, linting, testing, build validation
  migrate-database:
    # Database migrations (production only)
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    needs: quality-gates
```

### Database Migration Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

**Prisma Migration Strategy:**
- **Development**: Use `prisma migrate dev` for local schema changes
- **Production**: Use `prisma migrate deploy` for production deployments
- **Migration Commands**: `npx prisma migrate deploy` (no interactive prompts)
- **Connection**: Production DATABASE_URL from GitHub Secrets (Neon connection string)
- **Rollback**: Document manual rollback procedures using Prisma schema history + Neon branching

**Database Schema Validation:**
```typescript
// Migration verification steps
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma validate
```

### Development Workflow Integration
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

**Quality Gates Requirements:**
- **Type Checking**: `npm run type-check --noEmit` (must pass TypeScript strict mode)
- **Linting**: `npm run lint` (ESLint with TypeScript rules)
- **Unit Testing**: `npm run test` (Vitest with 80% coverage enforcement)
- **E2E Testing**: `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright for pull requests)
- **Build Validation**: `npm run build` (Next.js production build with dummy env vars)

**Branch Protection Strategy:**
- **Protected Branches**: main, staging
- **Required Checks**: quality-gates workflow status
- **Review Requirements**: Pull request reviews required
- **Merge Strategy**: Squash and merge preferred

### Project Structure Alignment
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**Required Directory Structure:**
```
codeflow/
├── .github/workflows/
│   └── quality-gates.yml           # Main quality gates workflow
├── scripts/
│   ├── migrate.sh                  # Manual migration script
│   └── cleanup-users.ts            # User cleanup automation
├── docs/deployment/
│   ├── github-actions.md           # GitHub Actions setup guide
│   └── database-migrations.md      # Migration procedures
```

**Environment Variables Validation:**
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All environment variables must be validated using Zod schemas in `lib/env.ts`
- CI/CD must use dummy values for build validation
- Production secrets managed through GitHub repository secrets

### Testing Standards Integration
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**CI/CD Testing Requirements:**
- **Test File Coverage**: Unit tests must achieve 80% coverage thresholds
- **Type Safety**: All tests must pass TypeScript strict mode compilation
- **Mock Configuration**: Use established mocks from tests/__mocks__/ directory
- **E2E Test Execution**: Headless Playwright execution in CI environment
- **Database Testing**: Use test database for E2E tests with proper cleanup

**Quality Gate Failure Handling:**
```bash
# Fast failure strategy
set -e  # Exit on first error
npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run build
```

### File Locations and Naming Conventions
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**GitHub Actions Files:**
- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml`
- Deployment documentation: `docs/deployment/github-actions.md`
- Migration scripts: `scripts/migrate.sh`

**Environment Configuration:**
- CI secrets: Configure in GitHub repository settings
- Dummy build variables: Hardcoded in workflow file for build validation
- Production DATABASE_URL: GitHub Secrets (from Neon)

### Vercel Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture/deployment-strategy.md]

**Vercel Integration:**
- **Automatic Deployment**: Vercel automatically deploys on push to main
- **Preview Deployments**: Vercel creates preview URLs for all PRs
- **Environment Variables**: Production secrets configured in Vercel Dashboard
- **Rollback Strategy**: Vercel Dashboard provides instant deployment rollback

**Database Migration Timing:**
1. Quality gates pass successfully in GitHub Actions
2. Code merges to main branch
3. Database migrations run via GitHub Actions (post-merge)
4. Vercel deployment triggers automatically
5. Application connects to migrated Neon database

## Testing

### Test File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml`
- Migration script: `scripts/migrate.sh`
- Branch protection configuration: GitHub repository settings
- Documentation: `docs/deployment/github-actions.md`, `docs/deployment/database-migrations.md`

### Testing Standards
**CI/CD Workflow Validation:**
1. Quality gates workflow executes successfully on pull requests
2. Database migration automation works in production environment
3. Branch protection prevents direct pushes to main branch
4. E2E tests run successfully in CI environment
5. Build validation passes with dummy environment variables
6. Vercel deployment integration works correctly

**Manual Testing Requirements:**
- Test pull request workflow with failing and passing quality gates
- Verify branch protection enforcement
- Test database migration rollback procedures
- Validate Vercel deployment integration
