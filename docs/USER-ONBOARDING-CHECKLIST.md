### Common Issues & Solutions

**GitHub Authorization Problems**

- **Issue**: No Slack messages received
- **Solution**: 
  1. Verify Slack OAuth connection in CodeFlow settings
  2. Check notification preferences aren't too restrictive
  3. Confirm you're not in quiet hours
  4. Send test notification from CodeFlow

**Dashboard Not Loading PRs**
- **Issue**: Empty dashboard or "No PRs found"
- **Solution**:
  1. Verify repository selection is correct
  2. Check that repositories have open PRs
  3. Wait 2-5 minutes for initial data sync
  4. Try manual refresh button

**Performance Issues**
- **Issue**: Slow dashboard loading
- **Solution**:
  1. Check internet connection
  2. Clear browser cache and cookies
  3. Try different browser
  4. Reduce number of monitored repositories temporarily
