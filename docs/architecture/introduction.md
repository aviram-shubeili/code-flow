# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **CodeFlow** - a developer productivity platform that transforms GitHub PR management through intelligent dashboards and Slack integration. It serves as the definitive technical blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

**Document Scope**: This architecture covers system design, technology selection, deployment strategy, security considerations, and performance optimization specifically addressing CodeFlow's unique challenges: GitHub API rate limiting, Slack integration workflows, and enterprise-ready developer workflow acceleration.

**Target Audience**: Development teams, DevOps engineers, and technical stakeholders who need to understand system boundaries, technology choices, and implementation approaches for CodeFlow's MVP and scale phases.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining development for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined, particularly given CodeFlow's serverless AWS deployment model.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield project**

This is a new project starting from scratch without an existing codebase or starter template. All architectural decisions will be made fresh based on the PRD requirements and technical assumptions.
