# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **CodeFlow** - a developer productivity platform that transforms GitHub PR management through intelligent dashboards and Slack integration. It serves as the definitive technical blueprint for features-first development, ensuring optimal architecture decisions based on real application requirements.

**Document Scope**: This architecture covers system design, technology selection, deployment strategy, security considerations, and performance optimization specifically addressing CodeFlow's unique challenges: GitHub API rate limiting, Slack integration workflows, and enterprise-ready developer workflow acceleration.

**Strategic Approach**: CodeFlow employs a **features-first development methodology**, building core application functionality before finalizing infrastructure decisions. This approach enables architecture choices based on actual performance characteristics, cost implications, and operational requirements rather than theoretical assumptions.

**Target Audience**: Development teams, DevOps engineers, and technical stakeholders who need to understand system boundaries, technology choices, and implementation approaches for CodeFlow's MVP and scale phases.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining development for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined. Infrastructure platform selection occurs in Sprint 3 after core features establish concrete requirements.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield project**

This is a new project starting from scratch without an existing codebase or starter template. All architectural decisions will be made fresh based on the PRD requirements and technical assumptions.
