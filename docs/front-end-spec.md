# CodeFlow UI/UX Specification

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for CodeFlow's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

**Primary: Mid-Size Development Team Members (5-15 developers)**
Software engineers using GitHub for code review and Microsoft Teams for daily communication. They work on shared repositories with moderate-to-high PR volume (10-50 PRs weekly). Currently spend 20+ minutes daily triaging PR notifications and lose track of PR status between review cycles.

**Secondary: Enterprise Development Team Members (15+ developers)** 
Engineers in larger organizations with multiple repositories, complex review requirements, and distributed teams across time zones. They handle hundreds of PR notifications weekly with complex ownership models and cross-team coordination challenges.

### Usability Goals

- **Individual Efficiency:** Power users complete PR triage in under 3 clicks; new users get guided assistance  
- **Cognitive Load Reduction:** Process 2x more PRs in same mental effort with intelligent categorization
- **Team Coordination:** Managers gain team bottleneck visibility without micromanaging individual developers
- **Rapid Onboarding:** New team members productive within first session, existing users easily invite teammates
- **Enterprise Ready:** Scales from 5 to 500 developers with security and compliance built-in

### Design Principles

1. **Outcome-focused clarity** - Show what needs to be done, with graceful handling of unclear states
2. **Progressive expertise** - Support novice guidance and expert efficiency simultaneously  
3. **Transparent team dynamics** - Surface collaboration patterns without sacrificing individual privacy
4. **Contextual communication** - Deliver notifications where developers work, with enterprise controls
5. **Scalable zero-setup** - Work immediately for individuals, scale to enterprise without reconfiguration

```

### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:** Four-section dashboard tabs with persistent visibility - "Needs Review" (with count badge), "Returned to You" (with urgency indicator), "My PRs" (with status overview), "Reviewed-Awaiting" (with time since last action)

**Secondary Navigation:** Contextual actions within each section - Filter/Sort controls, Team view toggle (for managers), Settings access, Help/Tutorial access for new users

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** Minimal breadcrumbs for deep navigation (Dashboard > PR Detail > Review Interface), with quick "Back to Dashboard" action always available. Teams integration uses deep linking to maintain context when users click through from notifications.

## User Flows

### Daily PR Triage

**User Goal:** Quickly identify and prioritize all PRs requiring immediate attention across multiple repositories

**Entry Points:** Direct URL, Teams notification click, browser bookmark, scheduled daily routine

**Success Criteria:** Complete assessment of all actionable PRs in under 3 minutes, clear next actions identified

    P -->|Yes| Q[Take merge or follow-up action]
    P -->|No| R[Triage complete]
    
    Q --> R
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- **Stale data:** Show "Last updated X minutes ago" with refresh button
- **API rate limits:** Graceful degradation with cached data and retry mechanism
- **Mixed permissions:** Clear indication when user can't access certain PRs
- **Overwhelming volume:** Progressive loading with "Show more" controls
- **Unclear status:** "Status unclear - check GitHub" with direct link

### Review Cycle Completion

**User Goal:** Complete a review cycle from initial notification through final approval/merge

**Entry Points:** Teams notification, dashboard "Needs Review", email fallback

**Success Criteria:** Review completed with clear outcome communicated to author and team

#### Flow Diagram

    N --> R[Merge notification to team]
    Q --> S{Approved?}
    S -->|Yes| R
    S -->|No| T[Additional review cycle]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- **Reviewer offline:** Escalation to secondary reviewers after defined timeout
- **Conflicting reviews:** Clear conflict resolution UI with team discussion thread
- **Large changesets:** Progressive loading with file-by-file review capability
- **External dependencies:** Integration status indicators with clear waiting states
- **Review fatigue:** Smart assignment rotation suggestions

- **State transitions:** Status badge changes with smooth color transition (300ms duration, ease-in-out easing)
- **Navigation:** Section transitions with slide effect (400ms duration, ease-out easing)
- **Notifications:** Toast notifications with slide-in from top (300ms enter, 200ms exit, ease-out easing)
- **Hover feedback:** Subtle scale and shadow effects on interactive elements (150ms duration, ease-out easing)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals
- **Page Load:** Initial dashboard load under 2 seconds on 3G connection
- **Interaction Response:** UI feedback within 100ms, data updates within 500ms
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps for all animations and transitions

### Design Strategies
Progressive loading with skeleton screens, lazy loading for PR details, efficient caching strategy for frequently accessed data, optimized image assets and icon sprite sheets, minimal JavaScript bundle sizes with code splitting
