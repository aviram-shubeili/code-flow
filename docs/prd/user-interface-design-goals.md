# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

CodeFlow's interface prioritizes developer productivity through immediate clarity and minimal cognitive overhead. The dashboard serves as a single source of truth that eliminates the need to constantly check GitHub notifications. The design philosophy centers on "outcome over events" - showing developers exactly what action they need to take rather than just what happened. Visual hierarchy and information architecture guide users to the most critical PRs requiring immediate attention while providing quick status awareness of their entire PR ecosystem.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Scan and Act**: Developers should be able to scan the four-section dashboard within 10 seconds and identify their next action
- **Context Preservation**: Clicking through to GitHub maintains context and returns users to the same dashboard state
- **Progressive Disclosure**: PR cards show essential info at a glance, with hover/click revealing additional details
- **Status-First Design**: Visual indicators (colors, icons, badges) immediately communicate PR status and urgency
- **Teams Integration Continuity**: Notifications received in Teams should link directly to relevant dashboard sections

### Core Screens and Views

- **Main Dashboard**: Four-section layout with "Needs Review", "Returned to You", "My PRs", and "Reviewed-Awaiting" sections
- **PR Card Detail View**: Expanded view showing full PR information, comments summary, and direct GitHub access
- **OAuth Connection Screen**: GitHub authentication and repository permission setup
- **Teams Integration Setup**: Microsoft Teams bot authorization and notification preferences
- **Settings/Preferences**: Repository filtering, notification frequency, and Teams integration management
- **Status/Health Dashboard**: System health, API rate limit status, and data freshness indicators

### Accessibility

**WCAG AA Compliance**: The platform will meet WCAG AA accessibility standards including keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and sufficient color contrast ratios for all visual status indicators.

### Branding

Clean, professional interface optimized for developer workflows. Design system will use familiar GitHub-inspired visual language with Microsoft Teams color palette integration for seamless context switching between platforms. Typography and spacing optimized for quick scanning of multiple PR cards simultaneously.

### Target Device and Platforms

**Web Responsive**: Primary focus on desktop browser experience (1440px+ screens) with responsive design supporting tablet devices (768px+). Mobile optimization deferred to post-MVP based on developer workflow patterns showing minimal mobile PR management usage.
