# Epic 5: MVP Performance and Reliability
**Goal**: Ensure MVP system reliability and basic performance requirements for initial validation

**User Stories:**

**US5.1 - Basic Performance Requirements**
- As a developer, I want fast dashboard loading so that I can quickly assess my PR status
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Dashboard initial load under 2 seconds (NFR1 compliance)
  - Basic database query optimization with essential indexing
  - Image and asset optimization for fast loading
  - Basic code splitting for main dashboard components
  - Simple performance logging (console metrics for MVP)
- **Definition of Done:** Dashboard consistently loads under 2 seconds, basic metrics captured

**US5.2 - GitHub API Rate Limit Handling**
- As a system user, I want the system to work even when GitHub API is rate limited so that my workflow isn't interrupted
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Basic caching strategy with 5-minute TTL for PR data
  - Graceful degradation with clear user messaging ("Data from 5 minutes ago")
  - Background sync processes that don't block user interface
  - Simple retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Manual refresh button with rate limit status
- **Definition of Done:** System remains functional during GitHub API rate limiting, users understand data freshness

**US5.3 - Data Freshness Indicators**
- As a developer, I want clear indicators when data is stale so that I understand information freshness
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Timestamp indicators on dashboard sections ("Last updated: 3 minutes ago")
  - Visual differentiation between fresh (<2 min) and stale (>5 min) data
  - Simple data age warnings when information is over 10 minutes old
  - Loading indicators during refresh operations
  - Manual refresh button always available
- **Definition of Done:** Users always understand how current their dashboard data is

**US5.4 - Basic Error Handling**
- As a user, I want clear error messages when things go wrong so that I can understand system status
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - User-friendly error messages for common failures (auth, network, rate limits)
  - Basic error logging to console (no external services needed)
  - Retry mechanisms for transient GitHub API failures
  - Fallback UI states when data is unavailable
  - Contact/support information for unresolved errors
- **Definition of Done:** Users understand system state during failures and can take appropriate action
