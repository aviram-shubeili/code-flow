# Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt
For UX design and wireframing phase:

"Based on this CodeFlow PRD, design a developer-focused dashboard interface that enables 10-second scan-to-action workflows. Focus on the four-section layout (Needs Review, Returned to You, My PRs, Reviewed-Awaiting) with PR cards optimized for essential information display. Consider GitHub-familiar visual language with Teams integration indicators. Prioritize desktop experience (1440px+) with responsive tablet support. Include system health indicators for API rate limiting awareness."

### Architect Prompt  
For technical architecture design:

"Design a scalable Next.js serverless architecture for CodeFlow that handles GitHub GraphQL API rate limiting intelligently while supporting Teams integration. Focus on AWS deployment using Lambda functions with PostgreSQL data layer. Plan for 5-50 concurrent users with mathematical GraphQL cost calculations and query optimization. Include enterprise SSO readiness and multi-layer caching strategy. Address peak hour performance (9-11 AM) and graceful degradation scenarios. Design GraphQL query patterns for efficient PR data retrieval and real-time updates."

### Development Roadmap Priority
1. **Phase 1 (True MVP - 2 weeks)**: Epic 0 (Project Setup) + Epic 1 (GitHub Auth) + Basic Epic 3 (Simple Dashboard)
2. **Phase 2 (Enhanced MVP - 4 weeks)**: Complete Epic 2 (PR Data Engine) + Complete Epic 3 (Full Dashboard UX)  
3. **Phase 3 (Teams Integration - 4 weeks)**: Epic 4 (Teams Integration)
4. **Phase 4 (Scale & Optimize)**: Epic 5 (Performance & Enterprise features like Redis, webhooks, advanced monitoring, GraphQL subscription optimization)
