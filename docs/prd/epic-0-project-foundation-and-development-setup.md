# Epic 0: Project Foundation and Development Setup
**Goal**: Establish development environment, tooling, and deployment pipeline

**User Stories:**

**US0.1 - Next.js Project Setup**
- As a developer, I want a Next.js project with TypeScript configured so that I can begin feature development
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Next.js 14+ project initialized with TypeScript support
  - App Router configuration (not Pages Router)
  - Basic folder structure: `/app`, `/components`, `/lib`, `/types`
  - TypeScript strict mode enabled
  - All code compiles without TypeScript errors
- **Definition of Done:** Project builds successfully, serves on localhost, TypeScript compilation passes

**US0.2 - Testing Framework Configuration**
- As a developer, I want Vitest testing framework set up so that I can write and run tests effectively
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Vitest configured with TypeScript support
  - Test utilities for React components (React Testing Library)
  - Mock configurations for external APIs
  - Coverage reporting configured (minimum 80% target)
  - Sample test files demonstrate testing patterns
- **Definition of Done:** `npm test` runs successfully, coverage reports generate, sample tests pass

**US0.3 - CI/CD Pipeline Setup**
- As a developer, I want CI/CD pipeline established so that code changes are automatically tested and deployed
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - GitHub Actions workflow for pull requests (test, lint, build)
  - Automated deployment to AWS production on main branch merge
  - Environment variable management for local and production environments
  - Build fails block merge to main branch
  - Deployment status reported back to GitHub
  - AWS credentials and IAM roles configured for secure deployment
- **Definition of Done:** PR triggers automated checks, successful merges deploy automatically to AWS production infrastructure

**US0.4 - Database Configuration**
- As a developer, I want PostgreSQL database set up so that I can store user and PR data
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Local development: Docker Compose with PostgreSQL container for consistent local development
  - Production: AWS RDS PostgreSQL instance provisioned
  - Database schema migration system (Prisma or similar) works across both environments
  - Initial table schemas for users, repositories, PRs, and sessions
  - Database connection pooling configured for production
  - Local database easily reset/seeded for development
- **Definition of Done:** Database connects in both local and production environments, migrations run successfully, local development is containerized

**US0.5 - Environment Management**
- As a developer, I want environment configuration set up so that I can manage development and production environments
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Local development: `.env.local` file for development secrets and configuration  
  - Production: AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or AWS Secrets Manager for secure environment variable management
  - Environment variables for GitHub GraphQL API credentials, database URLs, NextAuth secrets
  - Local environment easily configurable without AWS dependencies
  - Production environment variables automatically injected into Lambda functions
  - Environment validation on application startup with clear error messages
  - `.env.example` file documents all required environment variables
- **Definition of Done:** Environment variables work in both local and production, secrets are secure, local development doesn't require cloud dependencies
- **Definition of Done:** Application starts in all environments with proper configuration

**US0.6 - Code Quality Standards**
- As a developer, I want basic project structure and coding standards defined so that development follows consistent patterns
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - ESLint configuration with TypeScript rules
  - Prettier configuration for consistent formatting
  - Pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting
  - Code style guide documented
  - Import organization rules configured
- **Definition of Done:** Code passes linting, formatting is consistent, pre-commit hooks prevent style violations

**US0.7 - AWS Infrastructure Setup**
- As a developer, I want AWS infrastructure configured so that the application can be deployed to production
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AWS Lambda functions configured for Next.js API routes with proper IAM roles
  - S3 bucket set up for static asset hosting with CloudFront CDN
  - AWS RDS PostgreSQL instance provisioned for production data
  - AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or Secrets Manager configured for environment variables
  - IAM roles and policies configured for least-privilege access
  - Infrastructure as Code (AWS CDK or Terraform) for reproducible deployments
  - Lambda function memory and timeout optimized for GraphQL API calls
  - CloudFront caching strategy configured for optimal performance
  - RDS backup and monitoring configured
  - Cost monitoring and budget alerts configured
- **Definition of Done:** Complete AWS infrastructure deployed, Lambda functions connect to RDS, static assets serve from CloudFront, environment variables securely managed
