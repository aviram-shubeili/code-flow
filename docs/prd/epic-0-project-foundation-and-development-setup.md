# Epic 0: Project Foundation and Development Setup
**Goal**: Establish development environment and core application foundation with features-first approach

**Strategic Context**: This epic prioritizes application development over infrastructure setup, enabling architecture decisions based on real requirements rather than theoretical needs.

**Sprint Organization**:
- **Sprint 1 Priority**: US0.1, US0.2, US0.4 (application foundation)
- **Sprint 3 Priority**: US0.3, US0.7 (infrastructure deployment after features built)
- **Ongoing**: US0.5, US0.6 (development standards)

**User Stories:**

**US0.1 - Next.js Project Setup** [SPRINT 1 PRIORITY]
- As a developer, I want a Next.js project with TypeScript configured so that I can begin feature development
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Next.js 14+ project initialized with TypeScript support
  - App Router configuration (not Pages Router)
  - Basic folder structure: `/app`, `/components`, `/lib`, `/types`
  - TypeScript strict mode enabled
  - All code compiles without TypeScript errors
- **Definition of Done:** Project builds successfully, serves on localhost, TypeScript compilation passes

**US0.2 - Testing Framework Configuration**
- As a developer, I want Vitest testing framework set up so that I can write and run tests effectively
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Vitest configured with TypeScript support
  - Test utilities for React components (React Testing Library)
  - Mock configurations for external APIs
  - Coverage reporting configured (minimum 80% target)
  - Sample test files demonstrate testing patterns
- **Definition of Done:** `npm test` runs successfully, coverage reports generate, sample tests pass

**US0.3 - Quality Gates & Database Migration Setup** [SPRINT 3 PRIORITY]
- As a developer, I want quality gates and database migration automation established so that code quality is enforced and database changes are safely deployed while the chosen platform handles deployment automatically
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - GitHub Actions workflow for quality gates (test, lint, build validation)
  - Database migration automation for production deployments
  - Branch protection rules that work with Amplify's automatic deployment
  - Build quality gates that prevent bad code from reaching Amplify deployment
  - Database migration status reporting and rollback procedures
  - Integration with Amplify Gen 2's Git-based deployment workflow
- **Definition of Done:** Quality gates prevent bad code from reaching Amplify, database migrations are automated, Amplify handles deployment automatically on successful quality gate passage
- **Note:** Amplify Gen 2 handles the deployment pipeline automatically. This story focuses on quality assurance and database management that Amplify doesn't handle.

**US0.4 - Database Configuration**
- As a developer, I want PostgreSQL database set up so that I can store user and PR data
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Local development: Docker Compose with PostgreSQL container for consistent local development
  - Production: AWS RDS PostgreSQL instance provisioned
  - Database schema migration system (Prisma or similar) works across both environments
  - Initial table schemas for users, repositories, PRs, and sessions
  - Database connection pooling configured for production
  - Local database easily reset/seeded for development
- **Definition of Done:** Database connects in both local and production environments, migrations run successfully, local development is containerized

**US0.5 - Environment Management**
- As a developer, I want environment configuration set up so that I can manage development and production environments
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Local development: `.env.local` file for development secrets and configuration  
  - Production: AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or AWS Secrets Manager for secure environment variable management
  - Environment variables for GitHub GraphQL API credentials, database URLs, NextAuth secrets
  - Local environment easily configurable without AWS dependencies
  - Production environment variables automatically injected into Lambda functions
  - Environment validation on application startup with clear error messages
  - `.env.example` file documents all required environment variables
- **Definition of Done:** Environment variables work in both local and production, secrets are secure, local development doesn't require cloud dependencies
- **Definition of Done:** Application starts in all environments with proper configuration

**US0.6 - Code Quality Standards**
- As a developer, I want basic project structure and coding standards defined so that development follows consistent patterns
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - ESLint configuration with TypeScript rules
  - Prettier configuration for consistent formatting
  - Pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting
  - Code style guide documented
  - Import organization rules configured
- **Definition of Done:** Code passes linting, formatting is consistent, pre-commit hooks prevent style violations

**US0.7 - AWS Infrastructure Setup** [SPRINT 3 PRIORITY]
- As a developer, I want AWS infrastructure configured based on real application requirements so that the application can be deployed with optimal cost/performance characteristics
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Infrastructure platform selected based on Sprint 1-2 requirements analysis
  - Chosen platform (Amplify Gen 2, Pure CDK, or OpenNext+SST) configured with TypeScript infrastructure-as-code
  - PostgreSQL database provisioned with appropriate instance sizing
  - Environment management configured for secure deployment
  - Git-based deployment pipeline configured for chosen platform
  - CDN and caching strategy optimized for application performance patterns
  - Database backup and monitoring configured
  - Cost monitoring and alerting established
  - Infrastructure deployment is reproducible and environment-aware
- **Definition of Done:** Chosen infrastructure platform deployed successfully, Next.js application deployed and accessible, database operational, monitoring functional
- **Dependencies:** Requires completion of Sprint 1-2 feature development to inform infrastructure requirements
- **Platform Decision Criteria:** Cost efficiency, deployment complexity, learning value, maintenance overhead, future scalability needs
