# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Reduce PR review cycle time by 50% through personalized dashboards and intelligent categorization
- Achieve 80% daily active usage among development team members within first month of deployment  
- Eliminate 15-30 minutes of daily PR notification management overhead per developer
- Establish foundation for Teams-integrated developer workflow acceleration platform
- Deliver 70% engagement rate on Teams notifications (vs <20% for email notifications)
- Accelerate team velocity with 25% faster merge cycles for teams using full feature set

### Background Context

CodeFlow addresses critical inefficiencies in GitHub's PR management workflow that plague development teams. Current systems force developers to manually filter through notification noise, lose context between review cycles, and miss critical updates when working in communication platforms like Microsoft Teams. The platform transforms PR management from event-based notifications to outcome-focused workflow acceleration, meeting developers where they already collaborate.

The solution leverages Microsoft Teams integration as a key differentiator, creating an unavoidable notification system that delivers actionable status updates rather than generic PR events, fundamentally shifting focus from "what happened" to "what needs to be done."
