# Epic 1: Core Authentication and GitHub Integration
**Goal**: Establish secure foundation for GitHub data access and user management

**User Stories:**

**US1.1 - GitHub OAuth Authentication**
- As a developer, I want to authenticate with GitHub OAuth so that I can securely access my repository data
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - NextAuth.js configured with GitHub provider
  - OAuth flow handles authorization and callback
  - User session persisted securely
  - Login/logout functionality on dashboard
  - Error handling for OAuth failures (network, user denial, etc.)
  - Session expiration handled gracefully
- **Definition of Done:** Users can sign in with GitHub, sessions persist across browser refreshes, logout clears session

**US1.2 - Repository Permission Management**
- As a developer, I want to grant repository permissions so that CodeFlow can retrieve my PR information
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - GitHub App requests minimal required permissions (read:repo, read:user)
  - Clear permission explanation during authorization
  - Handles both public and private repository access
  - Graceful degradation for insufficient permissions
  - Permission revocation detection and user notification
- **Definition of Done:** Users can authorize repository access, system respects permission boundaries

**US1.3 - Token Management and Refresh**
- As a developer, I want my GitHub tokens to be automatically refreshed so that my access remains uninterrupted
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Automatic token refresh before expiration
  - Secure token storage with encryption at rest
  - Token refresh failure handling and user notification
  - Fallback to re-authentication when refresh fails
  - Audit logging for token operations
- **Definition of Done:** Tokens refresh automatically, users aren't interrupted by expired tokens

**US1.4 - Secure User Data Storage**
- As a system administrator, I want secure token storage so that user credentials are protected
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Tokens encrypted using industry-standard algorithms
  - Database connection uses SSL/TLS
  - No sensitive data logged in application logs
  - User data isolation between accounts
  - Compliance with GitHub's token storage requirements
- **Definition of Done:** Security audit passes, tokens properly encrypted, no credential leakage

**US1.5 - Repository Selection Interface**
- As a developer, I want to see my accessible repositories so that I can select which ones to monitor
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - List all accessible repositories (public and authorized private)
  - Filter/search functionality for repository selection
  - Bulk select/deselect capabilities
  - Repository metadata display (name, description, language, stars)
  - Save repository selection preferences
  - Real-time validation of repository access
- **Definition of Done:** Users can browse and select repositories, selections are persisted
