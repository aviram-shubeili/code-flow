# Epic 2: PR Data Retrieval and Processing Engine
**Goal**: Build robust PR data fetching with intelligent rate limiting and categorization

**User Stories:**

**US2.1 - GitHub API Integration**
- As a developer, I want the system to fetch PR data from GitHub so that my dashboard shows current information
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - GitHub GraphQL API v4 integration for efficient PR data retrieval
  - Custom GraphQL queries to fetch only required PR metadata (title, author, reviewers, status, comments) in single requests
  - Support for pagination using GraphQL cursors to handle repositories with many PRs
  - Incremental updates using GraphQL queries with timestamp filters (fetch only changed PRs when possible)
  - GraphQL query optimization to minimize API rate limit consumption
  - API response validation and comprehensive error handling
- **Definition of Done:** System successfully retrieves PR data from selected repositories using optimized GraphQL queries

**US2.2 - Data Storage and Caching**
- As a developer, I want PR data to be stored in the database so that the dashboard loads quickly
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - PR data stored in PostgreSQL with proper indexing
  - Database schema supports all PR metadata and relationships
  - Data synchronization between GitHub API and local storage
  - Timestamp tracking for data freshness indicators
  - Efficient queries for dashboard data retrieval (sub-500ms)
- **Definition of Done:** Dashboard loads from database quickly, data stays synchronized with GitHub

**US2.3 - Rate Limiting and Resilience**
- As a system, I want intelligent API rate limiting so that GitHub API limits are respected
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - GraphQL query batching and optimization to minimize rate limit consumption
  - Exponential backoff strategy when approaching rate limits
  - Rate limit monitoring and preemptive throttling based on GraphQL cost analysis
  - Graceful degradation when rate limited (serve cached data)
  - Different polling frequencies based on PR activity (active PRs polled more frequently)
  - Rate limit status and GraphQL cost tracking visible to users in dashboard
- **Definition of Done:** System never exceeds GitHub rate limits, continues operating when throttled, maximizes efficiency through GraphQL optimization

**US2.4 - PR Categorization Logic**
- As a developer, I want PR status categorization logic so that PRs appear in correct dashboard sections
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - **"Needs Review"**: PRs where user is requested reviewer, not yet reviewed
  - **"Returned to You"**: User's PRs with feedback/changes requested
  - **"My PRs"**: All PRs authored by user, with current status
  - **"Reviewed-Awaiting"**: PRs user has reviewed, awaiting author response
  - Handle edge cases (multiple reviewers, re-reviews, draft PRs)
  - Real-time recategorization when PR status changes
- **Definition of Done:** PRs appear in correct sections, categories update when status changes

**US2.5 - Error Handling and User Feedback**
- As a developer, I want clear error messages when APIs are limited so that I understand system status
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - User-friendly error messages for different failure scenarios
  - Distinguish between temporary (rate limiting) and permanent (permission) errors
  - Retry mechanisms for transient failures
  - System health indicators on dashboard
  - Error logging for debugging without exposing sensitive data
- **Definition of Done:** Users understand system status, errors are handled gracefully
