## Technique Sessions

### First Principles Thinking - 15 minutes

**Description:** Breaking down CodeFlow's core technical and UX challenges to their fundamental elements

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Finding PRs that need immediate/high attention
2. Tracking PRs that I reviewed until they are merged
3. Tracking my open PRs to speed up "time to merge"
4. Filtering, sorting, and grouping of open PRs (big repo/team scenarios)
5. See PR merge history of last 24 hours for regression detection
6. High attention = explicitly assigned to you (not team)
7. High attention = PRs touching areas you own/subscribe to
8. LLM-powered feature detection for personalized PR highlighting
9. Real-time notifications for key events
10. Minimize back-and-forth cycle gaps in review process

**Insights Discovered:**
- The core problem goes deeper than "signal vs noise" - it's about ownership and responsiveness
- Code ownership at individual level (not team) is critical but missing from GitHub
- Time gaps in review cycles are the real productivity killer
- Getting initial reviews is the biggest bottleneck

**Notable Connections:**
- LLM integration connects user-defined interests with PR content analysis
- Real-time notifications bridge the gap between PR events and developer attention
- Feature ownership creates personalized relevance beyond GitHub's team model

### Resource Constraints - 10 minutes

**Description:** Exploring "What if you had to deliver CodeFlow to your team in just 2 weeks?"

**Ideas Generated:**
11. Cut complex features: LLM integration, feature subscriptions, code ownership parsing
12. Essential 2-week MVP: OAuth, dashboard sections, PR cards, real-time notifications
13. Week 1 priorities: OAuth, basic dashboard, PR display, Teams integration
14. Simple polling (60 seconds) instead of complex push notifications
15. Local development first, deploy in week 2
16. Skip test environments for MVP speed
17. Focus on fastest tech stack implementation path

**Insights Discovered:**
- Teams integration could be faster to implement than browser push notifications
- Removing LLM complexity doesn't hurt core value proposition
- Local-first development accelerates initial team adoption

**Notable Connections:**
- 2-week constraint forces focus on highest-impact features
- Portfolio goals align with modern full-stack architecture choices

### Role Playing - 10 minutes

**Description:** Exploring from teammate and developer perspectives

**Ideas Generated:**
18. MS Teams as primary communication platform creates huge opportunity
19. Individual DMs preferred over channel spam for notifications
20. Teams Bot for individual messaging vs webhooks for channels  
21. Hybrid approach: Teams for offline + browser push for active users
22. Review outcome messaging: "APPROVED", "3 comments need addressing", "Changes requested"
23. Comment count as the key action trigger
24. Interactive Teams actions: "Start Review", "Acknowledge", "Quick Approve"

**Insights Discovered:**
- Teams integration could be the killer differentiator for adoption
- Review outcomes (not just events) drive user action
- Interactive notifications more valuable than passive information

**Notable Connections:**
- Teams usage makes CodeFlow notifications unavoidable (in good way)
- Interactive actions could make CodeFlow fastest PR workflow tool

### SCAMPER Method - 5 minutes

**Description:** Systematic improvement of Teams integration concept

**Ideas Generated:**
25. Dashboard badges synced with Teams notification status
26. Adaptive Cards for rich interactive Teams notifications
27. "Schedule Review" action for time management
28. "Request Clarification" quick response option

**Insights Discovered:**
- Teams platform offers richer interaction possibilities than initially considered
- Visual sync between notifications and dashboard creates cohesive experience

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well
- First principles thinking revealed deeper user needs beyond original MVP spec
- Resource constraints forced practical prioritization decisions
- Role playing from teammate perspective highlighted communication platform opportunity
- SCAMPER method quickly generated implementation variations

### Areas for Further Exploration
- Testing strategy for AI agent collaboration: Need to define clear acceptance criteria and feedback loops for AI-assisted development
- Deployment timing and strategy: When to move from local to cloud, staging environment needs
- Notification frequency and user control: Avoiding notification fatigue while maintaining responsiveness
- Scalability considerations: How architecture choices support future team growth

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques
- Morphological Analysis: Systematically map all technical stack combinations and deployment options
- Time Shifting: Explore "How would this be built in 2030?" for future-proofing insights
- Assumption Reversal: Challenge core assumptions about PR workflows and developer preferences

### Questions That Emerged
- How can we structure testing frameworks for AI agent development collaboration?
- What's the optimal notification frequency to avoid fatigue while maintaining responsiveness?
- Should we consider multi-platform support (Slack, Discord) from the start or focus deeply on Teams?
- How do we measure success for a team productivity tool?

### Next Session Planning
